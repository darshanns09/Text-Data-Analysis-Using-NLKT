Title: Web Scraping Data Extraction & Text Data Analysis

Description:
This project focuses on extracting URLs from an Excel file and subsequently scraping data from these URLs. Once the data is gathered, the project intends to conduct text analysis on the scraped content to derive meaningful insights.

#### Data Extraction:

The project begins with the extraction of URLs from an Excel file.
The Excel file may contain a list of URLs that point to web pages containing relevant data for analysis.

#### Web Scraping:

After extracting the URLs, the project involves scraping data from these web pages.
Web scraping techniques will be employed to extract structured data from HTML content.
Tools such as Python's Beautiful Soup or Scrapy framework may be used for efficient web scraping.

#### Text Data Analysis:

Once the data is collected, the project proceeds with text data analysis.
Text analysis techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) may be applied to analyze the scraped content.
Tasks include sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, topic modeling, and text summarization to derive insights from the textual data.
